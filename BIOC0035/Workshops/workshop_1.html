		<h1>Workshop 1 - The Crabtree Effect and Its Importance</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The Crabtree Effect describes the over-reliance on glycolysis of cell lines grown <em>in vitro</em> in high glucose media. Dr Blacker carried out an experiment studying this phenomenon, and you will be provided with the results of that experiment. In BIOC0035, 20% of the final mark will be on a report in which you analyse this data and discuss your interpretations. A series of workshops have been designed to help you with this report. When this series of workshops is completed, we will have progressed through the following stages:
			<ol>
	    		<li>Learning about the background and context of the Crabtree effect, and why it is worth researching.</li>
	    		<li>Learning about some key experimental techniques used to produce the data.</li>
	    		<li>Learning about the method of this specific experiment.</li>
			</ol>
		
		As you work through this material, it is recommended to take notes.</p>
		
		<h2>Drugs Are Tested on Cells Grown <em>in vitro</em></h2>
	    <p>Alongside efficacy, assessing the safety of potential drugs is an essential part of drug development. Before expensive clinical studies in humans are carried out, cell lines grown <em>in vitro</em> are exposed to the drug to check for negative impacts on human cells (<a href="https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/58235">ref</a>). Many potential drugs are discarded at this stage, saving research time, resources, and most importantly, lives.</p>
	    <p>While these types of studies have undoubtedly protected patients from harm, occasionally, some drugs are made available to the public that are later discovered to have unacceptably dangerous side-effects. One such example was a specific statin, cerivastatin (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1120974/">ref</a>), one of a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs that work by acting as competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis.</p>
	    <p>Statins have been effective at lowering blood cholesterol and leading to a decrease in cardiovascular events. However, although cerivastatin was approved in the US in 1997 as safe for use, it was withdrawn just a few years later (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1120974/">ref</a>) after 31 people died from rhabdomyolysis (the death of muscle fibers, potentially leading to severe consequences, such as kidney failure, due to the release of the muscle fiber contents into the bloodstream).</p>
	    <p>There are various suggestions as to why cytotoxicity studies sometimes fail to detect potentially dangerous compounds.</p>
	    <p>In one study, the impact of several statins on the oxygen consumption of muscle-derived mitochondria was tested. In figure 1, we see representative results; only pravastatin and cerivastatin are shown, but the results for the other statins tested were very similar to those of pravastatin.</p>

Oxygen consumption of cells was measured by oxygen electrode; oxidisable substrate and ADP were added to stimulate state 3 respiration (ADP-stimulated respiration), and then oligomycin was added to inhibit F1F0-ATPase. Test compounds diluted in DMSO were added after 2 minutes. No compounds were added to the control.(<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-006-6235-z">Source</a>)

	    <p>This is just one example of a drug that was determined to have low cytotoxicity, even though it was later found to impair mitochondrial function. This leads to the question of why the cytotoxicity of drugs that harm mitochondria can be missed when tested on cells grown <em>in vitro</em>, and yet still be harmful when taken by humans.</p>
		
		<h2>Metabolism of Cells Grown <em>in vitro</em></h2>
	    <p>Curiosity about the impact of culturing cells <em>in vitro</em> on their metabolism began decades ago, mainly to assess the extent to which results from cells grown in culture could be applied to cells in whole organisms. In one study, liver cells were isolated from adult rats and cultured in dishes as monolayers – this is referred to as a primary culture rather than a cell line – and were studied over 7 days in order to observe any changes in their metabolism.</p>

The rate of glucose (open circles) and lactate (solid triangles) uptake/release by the cells was measured over 7 days, per mg hepatocyte protein.

	    <p>This is just one study, but many studies over the years (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0070216108603597">ref</a>), in many different cell types, have shown that decreased oxidative metabolism and increased glycolysis, relative to similar cell types growing <em>in vivo</em>, is typical for cells grown <em>in vitro</em>. This reliance on glycolysis by cells in cell culture, is called the Crabtree Effect.</p>

		<h2>Circumventing the Crabtree Effect</h2>
	    <p>For some studies involving cells grown <em>in vitro</em>, researchers would prefer that the cells used more oxidative metabolism, as this is more realistic. As a result, various strategies have been tested to see if they are able to induce cells to carry out more mitochondrial, oxidative metabolism.</p>
	    <p>While growth media for cells may have concentrations of glucose as high as 25 mM, a commonly used method for inducing a more aerobic phenotype is to grow cells in galactose instead.</p>
	    <p>As shown in figure 3, cells grown in galactose consume oxygen at a higher rate and produce less lactate than cells supplied with glucose.</p>

Right: Concentration of lactate in cell medium after 7 days. (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028536">Source</a>)

	    <p>Multiple experiments in multiple cell lines have shown that galactose-grown cells are typically highly dependent on oxidative metabolism to meet their ATP requirements (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567724921000465#b0180">ref</a>).</p>
	    <p>Research has also shown that cells are more sensitive to damage by mitotoxic compounds when grown in galactose (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/97/2/539/1650344">ref</a>).</p>
	    <p>In one study, cells cultured in glucose or galactose were treated with antimycin, a toxin that inhibits complex III of the electron transport chain, disrupting the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation (see figure 4).</p>

				Figure 4. Cytotoxicity of drugs can differ in glucose-grown vs galactose-grown cells. Rabbit renal proximal tubule cells were grown in 17.5 mM glucose or 5 mM galactose and treated with varying concentrations of antimycin for 4 hours. Cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the growth medium, relative to untreated controls.

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	    <p>In conclusion, cells grown <em>in vitro</em> are typically cultured in media with physiologically high concentrations of glucose, which appears to cause a glycolytic phenotype in which cells are less reliant on their mitochondria and aerobic metabolism than cells generally are <em>in vivo</em>.</p>

		<h1>Workshop 3 - Investigating the Mechanism Behind the Crabtree Effect</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Cells grown in vitro are typically cultured in media containing high concentrations of glucose. In the blood of healthy humans, fasting glucose is typically around 4.5 mM, approaching approximately 15 mM in the fed state, while cell culture media may be 25 mM glucose. Cells grown in such media often exhibit the Crabtree Effect - increased activity of glycolysis at the expense of aerobic metabolism. Several alterations to cell culturing conditions have been found to encourage aerobic metabolism in clutured cells, and a common one is to use galactose (10 mM) in the media instead.</p>
		<h2>Metabolism of Glucose</h2>
		<p>Galactose is metabolised by the Leloir pathway (see figure 1), which converst galactose into glucose-6-phosphate with the net expenditure of 1 ATP in a process involving multiple enzymes. As glucose-6-phosphate feeds into glycolysis, the net ATP yield of galactose catbaolism is the same as that of glucose catabolism. Although the reliance of galactose-grown cells on aerobic metabolism has been established, the mechanism is not well understood, and there are several theories. However, this is not the question being studied in our BIOC0035 coursework.</p>

		<p>As we learnt in the first workshop, cells grown in galactose are already known to rely on aerobic metabolism, so they will make a useful comparison to cells cultured in glucose.</p>
		
		<h2>Inhibition of Aerobic Metabolism in the Presence of Glucose</h2>
		<p>Even moderate concentrations of glucose in the cell medium have been shown to decrease oxygen uptake (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02631415">ref</a>), but the mechanism is still under study. Between the glycolytic pathway and the consumption of oxygen are the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain.</p>
		<p>Inhibition of the citric acid cycle could explain the decreased oxygen consumption observed in the presence of glucose; likewise, the decreased oxygen consumption could also be explained by inhibition of the electron transport chain.</p>
		<p>In a cell utilising aerobic metabolism, the citric acid cycle converts mitochondrial NAD+ to NADH, while the electron transport chain converts mitochondrial NADH to NAD+.</p>

		<p>Inhibiting any point in a metabolic pathway can have upstream and downstream effects. It is often possible to identify the point at which inhibition is occurring by studying which compounds in that pathway are accumulating.</p>
		
		<h2>Investigating the Mechanism Behind the Crabtree Effect - The Experiment</h2>
		
		<p>In the rest of this workshop, we will virtually carry out the experiment that Dr Blacker performed, so that you can see how the data was generated.</p>
		
		<p>We have three samples of cells that have been cultured in glucose, and three samples that have been grown in galactose.</p>
		
		<p>By determining what percentage of total mitochondrial NAD is in the form of NADH in each of the growth conditions, we hope to understand how the relative activities of the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain differ in each of the growth conditions.</p>
		
		<p>The hypothesis we are testing is as follows:<br />Glucose decreases the activity of complex I of the electron transport chain.</p>
		
		<p><strong>When writing the discussion section of your report, you should consider how the results of this experiment relate to this hypothesis.</strong></p>
		
		<h2>Description of Method</h2>
		
		<p>This is a summary of the protocol:
			<ol>
				<li>Place a dish of cells into the confocal fluorescence microscope environmental chamber.</li>
				<li>Identify a suitable region of cells in the dish and adjust focus.</li>
				<li>Using a timer, take a picture of the cells every 30 seconds until the end of the experiment.</li>
				<li>At 5 minutes, add FCCP to the dish of cells.</li>
				<li>At 10 minutes, add rotenone to the dish of cells.</li>
				<li>Stop taking pictures at 15 minutes.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		
		<p>For more precise details of the experimental method, please refer to the method section of the report template on the Moodle site. In this workshop, we are more concerned with the practical aspects of treating the cells and collecting the images, and will only carry out the experiment on one sample of glucose-grown cells, and one sample of galactose-grown cells (Dr Blacker carried out the experiment using three samples for each condition).</p>		
	
		<h2>Carrying Out The Experiment</h2>
		<p>Follow the instructions in the window below to simulate the experiment. Pictures will be taken every 30 seconds automatically - this is represented by the camera, but in reality, microscopes have cameras attached. <strong>Get ready to add FCCP and rotenone at the correct times</strong>.</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>In this workshop we learned how mitochondrial NADH is linked to the activity of the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. We have looked at a summary of the protocol and carried out a virtual version of the experiment. The supporting Python videos will show you how to access the actual data from the real experiment, and how to analyse it. Please do get in touch if you have any further questions.</p>

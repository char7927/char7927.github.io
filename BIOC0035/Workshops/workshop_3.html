		<h1>Workshop 3 - Investigating the Mechanism Behind the Crabtree Effect</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Cells grown in vitro are typically cultured in media containing high concentrations of glucose. In the blood of healthy humans, fasting glucose is typically around 4.5 mM, approaching approximately 15 mM in the fed state, while cell culture media may be 25 mM glucose. Cells grown in such media often exhibit the Crabtree Effect - increased activity of glycolysis at the expense of aerobic metabolism. Several alterations to cell culturing conditions have been found to encourage aerobic metabolism in clutured cells, and a common one is to use galactose (10 mM) in the media instead.</p>
		<h2>Metabolism of Glucose</h2>
		<p>Galactose is metabolised by the Leloir pathway (see figure 1), which converst galactose into glucose-6-phosphate with the net expenditure of 1 ATP in a process involving multiple enzymes. As glucose-6-phosphate feeds into glycolysis, the net ATP yield of galactose catbaolism is the same as that of glucose catabolism. Although the reliance of galactose-grown cells on aerobic metabolism has been established, the mechanism is not well understood, and there are several theories. However, this is not the question being studied in our BIOC0035 coursework.</p>

		<p>As we learnt in the first workshop, cells grown in galactose are already known to rely on aerobic metabolism, so they will make a useful comparison to cells cultured in glucose.</p>
		
		<h2>Inhibition of Aerobic Metabolism in the Presence of Glucose</h2>
		<p>Even moderate concentrations of glucose in the cell medium have been shown to decrease oxygen uptake (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02631415">ref</a>), but the mechanism is still under study. Between the glycolytic pathway and the consumption of oxygen are the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain.</p>
		<p>Inhibition of the citric acid cycle could explain the decreased oxygen consumption observed in the presence of glucose; likewise, the decreased oxygen consumption could also be explained by inhibition of the electron transport chain.</p>
		<p>In a cell utilising aerobic metabolism, the citric acid cycle converts mitochondrial NAD to NADH, while the electron transport chain converts mitochondrial NADH to NAD.</p>

		<p>Inhibiting any point in a metabolic pathway can have upstream and downstream effects. It is often possible to identify the point at which inhibition is occurring by studying which compounds in that pathway are accumulating.</p>
		
		<h2>Investigating the Mechanism Behind the Crabtree Effect - The Experiment</h2>
		
		<p>In the rest of this workshop, we will virtually carry out the experiment that Dr Blacker performed, so that you can see how the data was generated.</p>
		
		<p>We have three samples of cells that have been cultured in glucose, and three samples that have been grown in galactose.</p>
		
		<p>By determining what percentage of total mitochondrial NAD (NAD+NADH) is in the form of NADH in each of the growth conditions, we hope to understand how the relative activities of the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain differ in each of the growth conditions.</p>
		
		<p>The hypothesis we are testing is as follows:<br />Glucose decreases the activity of complex I of the electron transport chain.</p>
		
		<p><strong>When writing the discussion section of your report, you should consider how the results of this experiment relate to this hypothesis.</strong></p>
		
		<h2>Description of Method</h2>
		
		<p>This is a summary of the protocol:
			<ol>
				<li>Place a dish of cells into the confocal fluorescence microscope environmental chamber.</li>
				<li>Identify a suitable region of cells in the dish and adjust focus.</li>
				<li>Using a timer, take a picture of the cells every 30 seconds until the end of the experiment.</li>
				<li>At 5 minutes, add FCCP to the dish of cells.</li>
				<li>At 10 minutes, add rotenone to the dish of cells.</li>
				<li>Stop taking pictures at 15 minutes.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		
		<p>For more precise details of the experimental method, please refer to the method section of the report template on the Moodle site. In this workshop, we are more concerned with the practical aspects of treating the cells and collecting the images, and will only carry out the experiment on one sample of glucose-grown cells, and one sample of galactose-grown cells (Dr Blacker carried out the experiment using three samples for each condition).</p>		
	
		<h2>Carrying Out The Experiment</h2>
		<p>Follow the instructions in the window below to simulate the experiment. Pictures will be taken every 30 seconds automatically - this is represented by the camera, but in reality, microscopes have cameras attached. <strong>Get ready to add FCCP and rotenone at the correct times</strong>.</p>

		<p>An additional complication is that upon the addition of FCCP, there is a slight change in the fluorescence intensity of the background (this effect was simulated in the previous workshop, but you may not have noticed). For all of these reasons, we need to determine the average brightness of the mitochondria, rather than the average brightness of the whole</p>
		
		<iframe id='ia_1' style='width:1000px; height:640px' src="ia_1/ia_1.html"></iframe>
		
		<p>You may notice that the average fluorescence intensity of the cells was not identical at the two different times. This is typical, the brightness varies due to a number of possible variables and it is not possible to fully control this.</p>

		<h2>Determining the Relative Concentrations of Mitochondrial NAD and NADH</h2>
		
		<p>In order to determine the relative concentrations of mitochondrial NAD and NADH, one technique uses compounds with known effects on the electron transport chain to determine minimum and maximum NADH levels, against which the normal NADH levels can be compared.</p>
		
		<h3>Carbonylcyanide-<em>p</em>-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP)</h3>
		
		<p>FCCP is a weak acid that, due to its extended delocalisation, is lipophilic even in its conjugate base form.</p>

		<p>Follow the instructions in the window below to see how adding FCCP impacts the NADH fluorescence of different samples of cells. Take note of the average fluorescence intensity before and after the addition of FCCP for each sample.</p>

		<p>Follow the instructions in the window below to see how adding rotenone impacts the NADH fluorescence of different samples of cells. Take note of the average fluorescence intensity before and after the addition of rotenone for each sample.</p>

		<h2>The Mitochondrial NAD Redox State Assay</h2>
		
		<p>Since uncouplers allow us to see the level of fluorescence of the mitochondria when no NADH is present, and inhibitors of the ETC show us the level of fluorescence of the mitochondria when all the NAD+NADH has been reduced to NADH, we can use the difference in fluorescence intensity between these two states to represent the total mitochondrial NADH, and then compare the fluorescence of the untreated cells to this range.</p>

			<figcaption>Figure 5. Resting mitochondrial NADH as a percentage of total mitochondrial NAD+NADH. Upper: Fluorescence intensity of cells at each time point reflects the proportion of NAD+NADH in the form of NADH, relative to the minimum and maximum fluorescence intensities. Lower: Equation for percentage of NAD+NADH in the form of NADH at time <em>t</em>.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>The fluorescence intensity after the addition of FCCP represents minimal mitochondrial NADH and the fluorescence intensity after the addition of rotenone represents maximal mitochondrial NADH. The initial fluorescence intensity is between these two values; it represents the relative levels of NADH prior to treatment and reflects the relative activities of the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain.</p>
		
		<p>Follow the instructions in the window below to see how adding FCCP and then rotenone impact the NADH fluorescence of different samples of cells. Take note of the average fluorescence intensity at each stage for each sample.</p>

		<p>Please note: These are simply simulations meant to help students understand the data collected by Dr Blacker. This simulation has <strong>not</strong> been set to produce realistic NADH percentages.</p>
		
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>In this workshop we covered what mitochondrial NADH can, and can't tell us about the relative activities of the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain, and how to use FCCP and rotenone to to give us a measure of total mitochondrial NAD+NADH against which we can compare mitochondrial NADH.</p>
		<p>In the final workshop, you will virtually carry out the experiment and collect your data. The data will be analysed with Python. Hopefully you have already spent time working through the Python material provided on the BIOC0035 Moodle site, so that you will have plenty of time to work on your report (results and discussion)... :)</p>

		<h1>Workshop 2 - Using Confocal Fluorescence to Study Mitochondrial NADH</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Glucose catabolism begins with glycolysis, an anaerobic pathway that takes place in the cytosol. In aerobic metabolism, the resulting pyruvate is taken up by mitochondria and converted to acetyl CoA. The citric acid cycle then catabolises the acetyl CoA, simultaneously reducing molecules of NAD to NADH, and the electron transport chain then reoxidises that NADH back to NAD, while using oxygen contributing to the production of ATP.</p>
		
		<p>The simultaneous activity of the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain results in a steady-state level of NADH, that reflects the relative activity of these two pathways.</p>
		
		<h2>Detecting Mitochondrial NADH in Living Cells</h2>
		<p>NADH is fluorescent, absorbing light at approximately 340 nm and emitting at approximately 460 nm, while NAD is not fluorescent (see figure 3 (left)). Figure 3 (right) shows the appearance of HeLa cells under a fluorescence microscope, set to detect NADH.</p>

		<p>Follow the instructions in the window below to look at the fluorescent NADH in a sample of living cells at two different times in the day. Take note of the average fluorescence intensity for each picture.</p>

		<p>You may notice that the average fluorescence intensity of the cells was not identical at the two different times. This is typical, the brightness is affected by a number of possible variables and it is not possible to fully control this.</p>

		<h2>Determining the Relative Concentrations of Mitochondrial NAD and NADH</h2>
		
		<p>In order to determine the relative concentrations of mitochondrial NAD and NADH, one technique uses compounds with known effects on the electron transport chain to determine minimum and maximum NADH levels, against which the normal NADH levels can be compared.</p>
		
		<h3>Carbonylcyanide-<em>p</em>-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP)</h3>
		
		<p>FCCP is a weak acid that, due to its extended delocalisation, is lipophilic even in its conjugate base form.</p>

		<p>Follow the instructions in the window below to see how adding FCCP impacts the NADH fluorescence of different samples of cells. Take note of the average fluorescence intensity before and after the addition of FCCP for each sample.</p>

		<h3>Rotenone</h3>

		<p>Follow the instructions in the window below to see how adding rotenone impacts the NADH fluorescence of different samples of cells. Take note of the average fluorescence intensity before and after the addition of rotenone for each sample.</p>

		<h2>The Mitochondrial NAD Redox State Assay</h2>
		
		<p>Since uncouplers allow us to see the level of fluorescence of the mitochondria when no NADH is present, and inhibitors of the ETC show us the level of fluorescence of the mitochondria when all the NAD+NADH has been reduced to NADH, we can use the difference in fluorescence intensity between these two states to represent the total mitochondrial NADH, and then compare the fluorescence of the untreated cells to this range.</p>

Upper: Fluorescence intensity of cells at each time point reflects the proportion of NAD+NADH in the form of NADH, relative to the minimum and maximum fluorescence intensities. Lower: Equation for percentage of NAD+NADH in the form of NADH at time <em>t</em>.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		
		<p>The fluorescence intensity after the addition of FCCP represents minimal mitochondrial NADH and the fluorescence intensity after the addition of rotenone represents maximal mitochondrial NADH. The initial fluorescence intensity is between these two values; it represents the relative levels of NADH prior to treatment and reflects the relative activities of the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain.</p>
		
		<p>Follow the instructions in the window below to see how adding FCCP and then rotenone impact the NADH fluorescence of different samples of cells. Take note of the average fluorescence intensity at each stage for each sample.</p>

		<p>Please note: These are simply simulations meant to help students understand the data collected by Dr Blacker. This simulation has <strong>not</strong> been set to produce realistic NADH percentages.</p>
		
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>In this workshop we covered what mitochondrial NADH can, and can't tell us about the relative activities of the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain, and how to use FCCP and rotenone to to give us a measure of total mitochondrial NAD+NADH against which we can compare mitochondrial NADH.</p>
		<p>In the final workshop, you will virtually carry out the experiment and collect your data. The data will be analysed with Python. Hopefully you have already spent time working through the Python material provided on the BIOC0035 Moodle site, so that you will have plenty of time to work on your report (results and discussion)... :)</p>

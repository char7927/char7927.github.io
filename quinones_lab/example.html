<h1>Step 1: Putting a tip on your pipette <span class='note'>(<a href="#">hide instructions</a>)</span></h1>
<p class='note'>(This is obviously not a serious step in the protocol, but let's pretend it is...)</p>
<p class='note'>We can apply CSS styling to make everything look nicer, but this example is just about what might be the text content.</p>
<p><b>PhD student:</b> The tips are up on that shelf there, so you'll need to get them down, then push the pipette into a tip, firmly, to make sure it is properly attached.</p>
<p class='note'>I would recommend putting your text outside of the animation, to keep things simple.</p>

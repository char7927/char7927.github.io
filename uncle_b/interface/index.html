<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>This typing interface allows you to write simply by opening your mouth.</p>
<p><img src="./images/whole_screen.jpg" height="60%"></p>
<p>The image above shows what the interface looks like. The main panel contains buttons for the letters of the alphabet. A small red arrow points at each of the top five letters in turn - open your mouth to select the letter that is being pointed at.</p>
<p>The small red arrow will also point at the down button in the right of the main panel - this button will select the next five letters.</p>

<h2>How do I move my mouth?</h2>
<p>Simply open and then close again.</p>
<p>When your mouth is detected as closed the dot in the lower right panel will be red. When your mouth is detected as open the dot will be green.</p>

<p>When your mouth has been open long enough to 'click' a button, the dot will turn brown. You have to close your mouth again before you can 'click' anything else.</p>

<h2>What happens if I choose a letter?</h2>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>The letter you choose will be written in the text box at the top of the main panel.</li>
		<li>The buttons will rearrange to put the most likely next letters at the top. </li>
		<li>The little red arrow will move back to the first letter.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<h2>What happens if I choose the next set of letters?</h2>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>The next set of buttons will move to the top. </li>
		<li>The little red arrow will stay in place, so you can choose the next set of letters more easily.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<h2>How do I delete text?</h2>
<p>The button with the red 'X' will delete one letter at a time.</p>
<p>The button with the Enter symbol will delete everything.</p>

<h2>Can anyone else use this at the same time?</h2>
<p>Yes! The red pointer is not actually the mouse, so anyone who is with you can speed things up by finishing off words, deleting clear mistakes, etc.</p>

<h2>Final Points</h2>
<p>You don't have to spell things perfectly. Even with multiple spelling mistakes text is still readable.</p>
<p>Make sure your camera is enabled.</p>
<p>Click allow when the browser asks for permission to access your camera.</p>
